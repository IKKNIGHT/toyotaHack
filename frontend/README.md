# frontend (Vite + React)

This folder contains a Vite + React scaffold for the ToyotaHack frontend.

Quick commands (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd C:\kida\toyotaHack\frontend
npm install
npm run dev      # start dev server at http://localhost:3000
npm run build    # build for production (output in dist/)
npm run preview  # preview production build
```

If you need TypeScript or additional tooling, I can add it.
